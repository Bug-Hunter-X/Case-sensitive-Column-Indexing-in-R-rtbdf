This repository demonstrates a common error in R programming related to case-sensitive column indexing in data frames.  The `bug.r` file contains code that attempts to subset a data frame using character vector indexing, resulting in an empty data frame due to a case mismatch in column names. The solution, provided in `bugSolution.r`, showcases how to avoid this issue by using case-insensitive indexing or ensuring exact column name matching.
