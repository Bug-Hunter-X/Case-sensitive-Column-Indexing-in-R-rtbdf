```r
# This code attempts to subset a data frame using character vector indexing,
# but it fails because the column names are not exactly as specified.

df <- data.frame(col1 = 1:3, Col2 = 4:6)

subset_df <- df[, c("col1", "Col2")]

#The above line throws a warning and returns an empty data frame, because "Col2" is different from "col2".

#This is a common error that occurs when working with case-sensitive strings or
#when there are typos in column names.
